# Problem

There is an exam with $N$ problems. For each problem, a participant can either choose to answer the problem or skip the problem. If the participant chooses to answer the problem and gets it correct, the participant is awarded $X$ points. If the participant chooses to answer the problem but answers it incorrectly, 1 point is deducted from their score. If the participant skipped the problem, there was no change to their score. For each of the following values of $N$ and $X$, compute the number of distinct scores the participant could obtain in the exam:

* (a) $N=7, X=4$
* (b) $N=15, X=18$
* (c) $N=30, X=20$

# Solution Ideas

* The first step is to write the problem mathematically. If (A, B, C) is the vector consisting of the number of (correct answers, incorrect answers, skip answers), then the equivalent problem is to find the number of elements in the set (unique because it is a set) $S =$ { $AX - B \mid A + B \leq N$ }.
* The first step is to always look for the simplest possible case i.e. $N = 1$. Observe that for $N = 1$, there are only 3 solutions { $-1, 0, X$ }.
